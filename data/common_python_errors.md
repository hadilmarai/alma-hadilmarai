Some frequent runtime errors in Python include:
- IndexError: accessing a list index that does not exist
- TypeError: using an operation on incompatible types
- RecursionError: exceeding the maximum recursion depth

These errors often indicate issues with boundary conditions or incorrect assumptions
about data structure size or function behavior.
