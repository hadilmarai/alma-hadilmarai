Debugging is the process of identifying, understanding, and fixing errors in a program.
Effective debugging often involves making the problem smaller, checking assumptions,
and observing program behavior step by step.

Common strategies include:
- Reproducing the error consistently
- Inspecting variable values at runtime
- Using print statements or a debugger
- Changing one thing at a time
